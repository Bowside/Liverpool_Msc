This is a repo for code developed as part of my MSc Computer Science and Artificial intelligence.
Each folder will be a seprate project, with its own readme.

The directory structure is as follows.

└───floyd_warshall          ~ Contains the assignment on implementing the floyd-warshall algorythim iteratively
    ├───floyd_warshall      ~ Class containing algorythm implementation
    ├───graphs              ~ Some sample graphs
    ├───tests               ~ Implementation tests
