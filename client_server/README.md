# Client Server
This is the end module assignment for the CSCK541 Software Development in Practice module

The application is a simple client/server network that is able to:

 - Create a dictionary, populate it, serialize it and send it to a server.
 - Create a text file and send it to a server.
 - With the dictionary, the user should be able to set the pickling format to one of the following: binary, JSON and XML. Also, the user will need to have the option to encrypt the text in a text file.
 
The server should have a configurable option to print the contents of the sent items to the screen and or to a file. Also, the server will need to be able to handle encrypted contents.
